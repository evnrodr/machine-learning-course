# 🚀 Machine Learning Course

## 💡 What this is about?
In this course I'm learning the basics of Machine Learning to advanced concepts. I'm seeing learning a lot of libraries such, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow and others.

## 💻 Technologies I've been using
* _Languages_: **Python**
* _Libraries_: **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow**
* _Environments_: **Miniconda, Jupyter Notebooks**

## 👨‍💻 My experience with it
I've always loved Machine Learning, since I've started Computer Science in Federal University of Ceará. Always had experiences with it, mostly theorectical and some practical. But time passed and now I realize that I need to learn Data Science and Machine Learning for my future, because of projects, laboratories and possible a Masters degree. So this course, it's probably a good way to start with hands on.

**OBS: I'll keep updating this repository as long as the course still active for me.**
